The "guess the code game". I'll add some other features later on, for now, it's pretty basic. 

## How to play

- Click a gray space, then pick a color on the left.
- Once you have 4 color spaces, press "grade" to see your score for that row:

### Scoring

- Each white peg means that one of the guessed pegs is correct, but is in the wrong hole.
- Each red (or black) peg means that one of the guessed pegs is correct, and is in the right hole.
- The order of the white and black pegs does not matter.

### End
If you guess the correct code, you win!
